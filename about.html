<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm based in Bucharest, Romania, and I work as a Business Analyst for a stockbroker. My main focus is on IT projects, where I bridge
the gap between business needs and technical solutions. I love being part of the process
that brings platforms and tools to life for users.</p>

<p>Before moving into the brokerage and tech world, I worked in the insurance industry,
where I gained valuable experience in analysis and client-focused solutions. That
background helped me develop a strong attention to detail and a problem-solving mindset, 
which I now apply daily in IT projects.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning and personal growth. Whether it's picking up 
new technical skills, understanding new business models, or just exploring new ideas, 
I enjoy the challenge. I'm always curious, always learning, and always ready for what's 
next.</p>
